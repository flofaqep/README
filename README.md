GitHub Account
--------------
- Register a new github account with a username chosen from the following random string generator. Try to choose an easy to pronounce relatable name by reloading the generated names if all sux :) https://www.random.org/strings/?num=20&len=8&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new
- Use an email address for the account that only you have access to and isn't likely to be seen by other curious parties.
- By just placing a dot ( . ) in a gmail address you could register on github with the same email you may already be using for an existing acoount
- Send me an email at hackmywifi@gmail.com containing your GitHub username and I'll drop you an invite.

Seriously WTF are these Names?

...yeah the idea is using random strings, so any malicious party against our interests is VERY unlikely to find this organization or any members of it.
