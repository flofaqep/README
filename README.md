=====
Try to mention, share, fork, or anything this repo that coud expose it to the public.
The entire idea of hiding in plain sight by being isolated on github may be a very bad one, but hey, lets try.

To Join Us, Do the Following!
=============================

GitHub Account
--------------
- Register a new github account with a username chosen from the following random string generator. Try to choose an easy to pronounce relatable name :) https://www.random.org/strings/?num=20&len=8&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new
- Use an email address for the account that only you have access to and isn't likely to be seen by other curious parties.
